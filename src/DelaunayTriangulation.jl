    DelaunayTriangulation

Module for computing Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi tessellations in two dimensions. There 
are many features available, including:

- Unconstrained and constrained Delaunay triangulations - see `triangulate`.
- Computation of Voronoi tessellations, clipped Voronoi tessellations (clipped to the convex hull), and centroidal Voronoi tessellations - see `voronoi`.
- Mesh refinement, with support custom angles and area constraints, as well as refinement of curve-bounded domains - see `refine!`.
- Dynamic updates such as point insertion and segment insertion - see e.g. `add_point!`, `delete_vertex!`, and `add_segment!`.
- Computation of convex hulls - see `convex_hull` (or use `get_convex_hull` on a computed triangulation).
- Triangulation of convex polygons - see `triangulate_convex`. Lattices can also be triangulated, see `triangulate_rectangle`.
- Point location - see `find_triangle` and `find_polygon`.
- Computation of the pole of inaccessibility - see `DelaunayTriangulation.pole_of_inaccessibility`.

See the documentation for more, and the package's associated GitHub repository's README.
