    pole_of_inaccessibility(pts, boundary_nodes; precision = one(number_type(pts)))

Given a collection of points `pts` and a set of `boundary_nodes` defining the polygon
connections, finds the pole of inaccessibility. This works for multiply-connected polygons, 
provided `boundary_nodes` matches the specification given in the documentation. You can 
control the tolerance of the returned pole using `precision`.

This function is also commonly called `polylabel`.

!!! note 

    The pole of inaccessibility is a point within a polygon that is furthest from an 
    edge. It is useful for our purposes since it is a representative point that is 
    guaranteed to be inside the polygon, in contrast to for example a centroid which 
    is not always inside the polygon.

    For more information about this, see e.g. [this blog post](https://blog.mapbox.com/a-new-algorithm-for-finding-a-visual-center-of-a-polygon-7c77e6492fbc)
    or [the original repo](https://github.com/mapbox/polylabel). This implementation was partially based 
    on [the python implementation](https://github.com/Twista/python-polylabel) and [this other Julia implementation](https://github.com/asinghvi17/Polylabel.jl).
