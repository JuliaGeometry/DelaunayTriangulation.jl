an edge that intersects a boundary edge and one to it has its shared vertex added to the queue together with the current polygon (`current_incident_polygon`) being 
considered, and any intersections have the adjacent polygon added to the queue together with the intersecting edge. These are not strictly 
the rules in the paper, but they are the rules that I was able to implement since they do not share their code.
