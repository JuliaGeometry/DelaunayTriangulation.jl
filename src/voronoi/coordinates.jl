    get_polygon_coordinates(vorn::VoronoiTessellation, i; bounding_box = nothing)

Returns a vector for the coordinates of the `i`th polygon in `vorn`. If `bounding_box` 
is provided, the polygon will be clipped to the bounding box, assuming that it takes 
the form `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`. Some specific cases:

- If the polygon is unbounded but `bounding_box` is `nothing`, then an error will be thrown. 
- If the polygon is bounded and `bounding_box` is `nothing`, then the polygon coordinates will be returned as if without any clipping.
- If the polygon is outside of the bounding box entirely, then an empty vector will be returned.

    polygon_position_relative_to_box(vorn::VoronoiTessellation, bounding_box, i)

Tests the position of the `i`th polygon of `vorn` relative to the bounding box`, ignoring 
boundary indices. Returns:

- `Cert.Inside`: The polygon is contained entirely within the box.
- `Cert.Outside`: The polygon is entirely outside the box.
- `Cert.Touching`: The polygon is contained entirely within the box, but touches the boundary of the box. Note that if a polygon touches the boundary of the box but is entirely outside otherwise, `Cert.Outside` will be returned instead. 
- `Cert.Multiple`: The polygon intersects the box in multiple places.
