abstract = {Star splaying is a general-dimensional algorithm that takes as input a triangulation or an approximation of a convex hull, and produces the Delaunay triangulation, weighted Delaunay triangulation, or convex hull of the vertices in the input. If the input is "nearly Delaunay" or "nearly convex" in a certain sense quantified herein, and it is sparse (i.e. each input vertex adjoins only a constant number of edges), star splaying runs in time linear in the number of vertices. Thus, star splaying can be a fast first step in repairing a high-quality finite element mesh that has lost the Delaunay property after its vertices have moved in response to simulated physical forces. Star splaying is akin to Lawson's edge flip algorithm for converting a triangulation to a Delaunay triangulation, but it works in any dimensionality.},
