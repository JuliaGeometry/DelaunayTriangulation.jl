# # Using Custom Structs for Primitives and Boundaries 
# 

# In this package, we allow for custom structs to be used for defining 
# points, edges, triangles, and boundaries (and parametric curves, as done for 
# example in the final example of [this tutorial](../tutorials/curve_bounded.md)).
# This tutorial demonstrates how this can be done, showing what methods need to be 
# defined to use certain parts of the package. We note that there are some good defaults 
# already defined for most methods that can be overloaded for these primitives, but for 
# completely new structs you are required to define many new methods. 
# The packages we will be using are loaded below.

# Now, depending on your application you might not need to define all possible methods. For example, if you just want an unconstrained triangulation, all you need are `CustomPoint` 
# and `CustomPoints`. So, let's define our methods for increasing complexity. First, for unconstrained triangulations, all we need to define are:
DT.getx(p::CustomPoint) = p.x
DT.gety(p::CustomPoint) = p.y
DT.number_type(::Type{CustomPoint}) = Float64

Base.eachindex(points::CustomPoints) = Base.eachindex(points.points)
Base.iterate(points::CustomPoints, state...) = Base.iterate(points.points, state...)
Base.length(points::CustomPoints) = length(points.points)
Base.getindex(points::CustomPoints, i) = points.points[i]
DT.number_type(::Type{CustomPoints}) = Float64

DT.geti(T::CustomTriangle) = T.i
DT.getj(T::CustomTriangle) = T.j
DT.getk(T::CustomTriangle) = T.k
DT.number_type(::Type{CustomTriangle}) = Int32
DT.construct_triangle(::Type{CustomTriangle}, i, j, k) = CustomTriangle(i, j, k)

Base.iterate(triangles::CustomTriangles, state...) = Base.iterate(triangles.triangles, state...)
Base.sizehint!(triangles::CustomTriangles, n) = sizehint!(triangles.triangles, n)
Base.eltype(::Type{CustomTriangles}) = CustomTriangle
Base.push!(triangles::CustomTriangles, T::CustomTriangle) = push!(triangles.triangles, T)
Base.delete!(triangles::CustomTriangles, T::CustomTriangle) = deleteat!(triangles.triangles, findfirst(==(T), triangles.triangles))
Base.length(triangles::CustomTriangles) = length(triangles.triangles)
CustomTriangles() = CustomTriangles(Vector{CustomTriangle}())

# Now let's suppose we want to add in some segments. For this, we also need the following methods.
DT.construct_edge(::Type{CustomSegment}, i, j) = CustomSegment(i, j)
DT.initial(e::CustomSegment) = e.i
DT.terminal(e::CustomSegment) = e.j

Base.iterate(segments::CustomSegments, state...) = Base.iterate(segments.segments, state...)
Base.eltype(::Type{CustomSegments}) = CustomSegment
Base.push!(segments::CustomSegments, e::CustomSegment) = push!(segments.segments, e)
Base.delete!(segments::CustomSegments, e::CustomSegment) = delete!(segments.segments, e)
Base.rand(rng::AbstractRNG, segments::CustomSegments) = rand(rng, segments.segments)
Base.length(segments::CustomSegments) = length(segments.segments)
CustomSegments() = CustomSegments(Set{CustomSegment}())

# Next, we want to allow for defining a boundary. For this, we need the following methods.
DT.has_multiple_curves(::CustomPolygons{N}) where {N} = N > 1
DT.has_multiple_curves(::CustomPolygon) = false
DT.has_multiple_curves(::CustomPolygonSegment) = false
DT.has_multiple_sections(::CustomPolygons) = true
DT.has_multiple_sections(::CustomPolygon) = true
DT.has_multiple_sections(::CustomPolygonSegment) = false
DT.num_curves(::CustomPolygons{N}) where {N} = N
DT.num_sections(poly::CustomPolygon) = length(poly.segments)
DT.num_boundary_edges(seg::CustomPolygonSegment) = length(seg.segments)
DT.get_boundary_nodes(poly::CustomPolygons, m::Integer) = poly.polygons[m] # go down to the mth polygon 
DT.get_boundary_nodes(poly::CustomPolygon, m::Integer) = poly.segments[m] # go down to the mth segment
DT.get_boundary_nodes(seg::CustomPolygonSegment, m::Integer) = m > length(seg.segments) ? DT.terminal(seg.segments[m - 1]) : DT.initial(seg.segments[m]) # go down to the mth edge and extract the left node 
DT.get_boundary_nodes(poly::CustomPolygons, (m, n)::NTuple{2, Int32}) = DT.get_boundary_nodes(DT.get_boundary_nodes(poly, m), n)

# We now have all that we need for defining our custom primitives for constrained triangulations. We can go further and define methods 
# for working with Voronoi tessellations and centroidal Voronoi tessellations. For these methods, note that these only apply to unconstrained 
# triangulations, so you of course would not have to define the methods we have just defined for segments and boundaries. For Voronoi tessellations, 
# no extra methods are needed, except for 
Base.empty!(segments::CustomSegments) = empty!(segments.segments)

# if we specify `EdgesType` inside `triangulate` together with `clip=true` (and not otherwise). For centroidal Voronoi tessellations, we need 
DT.set_point!(points::CustomPoints, i, x, y) = points.points[i] = CustomPoint(x, y)

# We also need to consider methods needed for mesh refinement. We could also consider how we can define a method for a new parametric curve, 
# but an example of this is already given in the [curve bounded tutorial](../tutorials/curve_bounded.md), so we will only consider methods 
# with piecewise linear boundaries. For refinement, we need the following methods: 
Base.pop!(points::CustomPoints) = pop!(points.points)
DT.push_point!(points::CustomPoints, x, y) = push!(points.points, CustomPoint(x, y))

DT.contains_edge(e::CustomSegment, Es::CustomSegments) = e âˆˆ Es.segments

Base.empty!(triangles::CustomTriangles) = empty!(triangles.triangles)

function Base.insert!(seg::CustomPolygonSegment, index, node)
    cur_segment = seg.segments[index - 1]
    u, v = edge_vertices(cur_segment)
    seg.segments[index - 1] = CustomSegment(u, node)
    insert!(seg.segments, index, CustomSegment(node, v))
    return seg
